based on it being mysql and not sqllite we should actually all be able to host it locally and we'll just make a scheme for updating entries and such later so that they all match up.
But for the purposes of the tables etc it will work.

This way you can code through visual studio and then branch whatever your working on and push to main when the time comes.
